             First release of the image.

01-20-2016 - <giuseppe.natale@xilinx.com>
             1)	Full support for the popular python packages (matplotlib, 
                pandas, numpy, scipy..ecc for a list type `help(modules)` 
                in a python shell)
             2) A first release of pyxi is available and it can be imported 
                from Jupyter. Just remember to launch jupyter with ‘sudo’ 
                (as specified by the message in ./configure_jupyter.h) since 
                we need root permissions to use pyxi. Currently, only 
                on-board device (LEDs, Switches, Buttons) are supported, the
                rest is still there but is leftover from the old release, 
                therefore is not usable.

01-21-2016 - <giuseppe.natale@xilinx.com>
             Added support for install/update of pyxi using pip
             run this command from the home directory (/home/xpp)
             <sudo -H pip install -e 'git+https://github.com/Xilinx/Pyxi@master#egg=pyxi&subdirectory=python'>
             the entire repo will be cloned in /home/xpp/src/pyxi, with the
             package located in /home/xpp/src/pyxi/python/pyxi
