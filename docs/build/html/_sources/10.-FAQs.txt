Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
=================================

Why ...
-------

... What is Jupyter?
   


... Do you support Python 2.7?
   Python 2.7 is loaded on Zynq and Python 2.7 scripts can be executed. Pynq, however, is based on Python 3.  No attempts have been made to ensure backward compatibility with Python 2.7.


... What is an overlay
   FPGA overlays are FPGA designs that are themselves configurable and typically optimized for a given domain.  We refer to them as post-bitstream programmable designs.  Such overlays are created to be re-used in more than one application.

   Consider the example of building a Zynq-based system for controlling a drone.  The designer may design exactly the system he needs for the immediate drone application.  Alternatively he may recognize that many drone controllers have quite similar requirements.  He can design a more configurable, FPGA design and export an API (application programming interface) for use by the embedded software programmers.  This single bitstram can then be customized via its API for use in different drone control projects.

   Note that the use of overlays does not imply the use of partial or dyamic reconfiguration. Some overalys can employ such techniques to good pupose but their use is optional.
