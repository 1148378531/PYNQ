Pynq for ZYBO is a beta-stage deliverable from the Pynq team.  Each prototype is distributed as a kit that includes all the necessary hardware and software components to run Python scripts on Zynq and to interact with peripherals on the board and external to it.

The main website for the project is located at `Pynq <https://github.com/Xilinx/Pynq>`_.  Documentation is provided at the github site's `wiki pages <https://github.com/Xilinx/Py/wiki>`_.  If you need technical support, issues can be submitted via the github site's `issue tracker <https://github.com/Xilinx/Pynq/issues>`_.

.. NOTE::
  1. This beta deliverable of Pynq on ZYBO runs natively on the Zynq ARM A9 CPUs.  The CPUs run a web server which host the main Pynq portal.  Any computing  platform that is connected to the Internet and supports a mainstream web browser, such as Chrome, Internet Expolrer, Firefox or Safari, can connect to the Pynq portal.  This should work equally well with all manner of laptops and desktops, indepndent of whether they run Windows, OSX or Linux. 

  2. Pynq on Zybo does not try to teach Python programming to first-time users. Programmers who are familiar with other languages, will pick up much of the fundamentals of Python quickly from the examples in these notes. Nonetheless, Python is a very comprehensive language with many advanced features that may require additional study.  For these reasons we have provided links to excellent `Python training material <https://github.com/Xilinx/XilinxPythonProject/wiki/9.-Useful-Reference-Links#useful-reference-links>`_


Three main steps
================

There are three main steps (each with several smaller steps) to getting started with Pynq with the ZYBO board.  These are:


* **1. Configure ZYBO and connect it to your host machine and network**

 * Set the board jumpers correctly
 
 * Insert the micro SD card provided
 
 * Provide power to ZYBO by connecting it to the USB port of your host computer
 
 * Connect the board to the same network that your host is connected to

 * Switch on ZYBO and verify that the status LEDs indicate successful boot-up


* **2. Open a web browser and connect to Pynq web portal**

 * Using a web browser, open the site pynq:9090
 
 * When prompted enter the password `pynq` to launch the Jupyter dashboard


* **3. Familiarize yourself with Jupyter dashboard and notebooks**

 * From the Jupyter dashboard navigate to the Getting Started folder and open a Jupyter notebook

 * Open a simple Jupyter notebook and execute some python scripts

 * Explore the series of *Getting Started Notebooks* to learn more about  Pynq and how to use the overlays provided to control the peripherals on the Zybo itself as well as other peripherals that can be attached to it.



Hardware installation
=====================

Prerequisites
-------------

* Laptop or desktop with Internet browser (Windows, OSX or Linux)

*If you received your Zybo board from the Pynq team, all jumpers will be set correctly.*

You can view the `Zybo Setup Video <https://github.com/Xilinx/Pynq/blob/master/micropython/docs/videos/setup_zybo.mp4?raw=true>`_ or follow the steps below.

1. Insert the *Micro SD* card into the ZYBO. (Micro SD slot is underneath the board)

2. Change the JP5 jumper  to **SD** (Set the board to boot from the Micro SD card)  

3. Set the JP7 jumper to *USB* (Power the board from the USB cable)

4. Plug the USB cable to your PC/Laptop, and connect to *PROG UART* (J11) on the board

5. *Turn on* the power switch on the board

When you power on the board, you should see a *RED LED* (PGOOD) and a *GREEN LED* (DONE) indicating the system has booted successfully.
