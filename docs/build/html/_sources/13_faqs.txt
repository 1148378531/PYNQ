Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
=================================


* Do you support Python 2.7?
   Python 2.7 is loaded on Zynq and Python 2.7 scripts can be executed. Pynq, however, is based on Python 3.  No attempts have been made to ensure backward compatibility with Python 2.7.


* What is an overlay
   FPGA overlays are FPGA designs that are themselves configurable and typically optimized for a given domain.  We refer to them as post-bitstream programmable designs.  Such overlays are created to be re-used in more than one application.

   Consider the example of building a Zynq-based system for controlling a drone.  The designer may design exactly the system he needs for the immediate drone application.  Alternatively he may recognize that many drone controllers have quite similar requirements.  He can design a more configurable, FPGA design and export an API (application programming interface) for use by the embedded software programmers.  This single bitstream can then be customized via its API for use in different drone control projects.

   Note that the use of overlays does not imply the use of partial or dynamic reconfiguration. Some overlays can employ such techniques to good purpose but their use is optional.
   

* I can't connect to the board
   
   After you power on the board, it usually takes about 30-40 seconds for the board to boot. Make sure you leave enough time to connect to the board. It may also take some additional time for your PC to resolve the hostname to the IP address of the board. 
   
   1. Check the `Getting Started Guide <2_getting_started.html>`_ to make sure you have set up the hardware correctly
   
   2. Determine if you are using a Dynamic IP address, or a Static IP address
   
   If you connect directly to the Ethernet port of your PC, you should have a Static IP address. The default static IP address for the board is ''192.168.2.99''.
   
   Check that you can ping the board from a command prompt or terminal on your host PC
   
   .. code-block:: console
   
      # replace pynq with correct hostname if you have changed it
      ping pynq
   
   If you need to change your IP address on your host PC, see the instructions below.
   
   You can connect to the board using a terminal for trouble shooting, and to check the IP address and hostname. See connecting using a terminal below. 

* I have followed the Getting Started Guide, I see a Red Led, but not a green Led when I power on the board. 
   Check the Micro-SD card is inserted correctly (the socket is spring loaded, so push it in until you feel it click into place). Check or reflash the Micro SD card with eh pynq image. 

* How do I connect to the board using a terminal?
   To do this, you need to connect to the board using a terminal.
   
   To connect a terminal
   Plug in a USB cable, and connect to the board using a terminal emulator. 
   
   Terminal Settings: 
   
   * 115200 baud
   * 8 data bits
   * 1 stop bit
   * No Parity
   * No Flow Control
   
   Once you connect to the board, you can configure the network interface in Ubuntu

   
* How do I configure my network interface/Ethernet Port? 

Windows:

You can manually configure the IP address of your ethernet port to be in the same range as the board. e.g. The board default IP address is 192.168.2.99. Choose 192.168.2.1 for your PC's IP address.

You can also use the provided Windows batch scripts in Pynq/ubuntu/scripts to enable a Windows machine's Ethernet port to also use static IP addressing.

* My hostname is not resolving
   If you know the IP address of Zybo, you can use it to navigate to the Pynq portal. e.g.  http://192.168.2.99:9090


* My Board is powered on, and I see the Red and Green LEDs, but I can't connect to the Pynq Portal, or see the Samba shared drive.
   By default, the board has DHCP enabled. If you plug the board into a home router, or network switch connected to your network, it should be allocated an IP address automatically. If not, it should fall back to a static IP address of 192.168.2.99
   
   If you plug the Ethernet cable directly to your computer, you will need to change the configure your network card to have an IP in the same address range.  
   
* My board is connected, and I have verified the IP addresses on the board, and for my network interface, but I cannot connect to the board
   If you are connected to a VPN, this will block access to local IP addresses, unless you have set the VPN to bypass the board address.


   
* How to I modify the Zybo Ubuntu operating system?
   Connect to the board using a terminal, and change the settings as you would for any other Ubuntu machine.  Zybo comes with a standard Ubuntu 15.10 build.   
   
* How to find the IP address of the board
   Connect to the board using a terminal (see above) and type 'hostname -I' to find the IP address for the eth0 Ethernet adapter
   
* How do I set/change the static IP address on the board 
   The Static IP address is set in /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf  - you can modify the board's static IP there
   
* How to find my hostname   
   Connect to the board using a terminal and run 'hostname'
   
* Change the hostname
   If you have multiple boards on the same network, you should give them different host names. 
   You can run the following script to change the hostname:
   sudo /home/xpp/scripts/hostname.sh NEW_HOST_NAME
   
* What is the user account and password?
   Username and password for all linux, jupyter and samba logins are: xpp/xpp
