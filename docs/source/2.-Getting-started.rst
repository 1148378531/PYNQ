Pynq for ZYBO is a beta-stage deliverable from the Pynq team.  The full cource code for the project is available on the  `Pynq project GitHub<https://github.com/Xilinx/Pynq>`_. The source code is compiled to an bootable image for the Zybo. Zybo is currently the only officially supported platform, but the project could be ported to other Zynq platforms and the project team plan to support other Zynq platforms in the future. It is intended that Pynq will be used with a Zynq board and optionally external peripherals. 

Documentation is available directly from the board. Once the board is running, navigate to <hostname>. 
The documentation will also be available on readthedocs.org. 
Any issues can be submitted via the github site's `issue tracker <https://github.com/Xilinx/Pynq/issues>`_.

.. NOTE::
  1. This beta deliverable of Pynq on ZYBO runs natively on the Zynq ARM A9 CPUs.  The CPUs run a web server which host the main Pynq portal.  Any computing  platform that is connected to the Internet and supports a mainstream web browser, such as Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox or Safari, can connect to the Pynq portal.  This should work equally well with all manner of laptops and desktops, independent of whether they run Windows, OSX or Linux. 

  2. Pynq on Zybo does not try to teach Python programming to first-time users. Programmers who are familiar with other languages, will pick up much of the fundamentals of Python quickly from the examples in these notes. Nonetheless, Python is a very comprehensive language with many advanced features that may require additional study.  For these reasons we have provided links to excellent `Python training material <https://github.com/Xilinx/XilinxPythonProject/wiki/9.-Useful-Reference-Links#useful-reference-links>`_


Three main steps
================

There are four main steps (each with several smaller steps) to getting started with Pynq and the ZYBO board.  These are:

* **1 Download the image and prepare the SD Card
 * For now you will need to obtain the image directly from the Pynq team
 * The image can be copied to a micro SD card using `Win32DiskImager <https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/>`_

* **2. Configure ZYBO and connect it to your host machine and network**

 * Set the board jumpers correctly
 
 * Insert the micro SD card 
 
 * Provide power to ZYBO by connecting the USB cable
 
 * Connect the board to the same network that your host is connected to

 * Switch on ZYBO and verify that the status LEDs indicate successful boot-up

DHCP is enabled by default. If you connect the board to a home router, it should obtain an IP address automatically. You can also connect a terminal to the board and change the Ubuntu network settings manually.

* **3. Open a web browser and connect to Pynq web portal**

 * Using a web browser, open the address  `pynq:9090 <http://pynq:9090>`_
 
 * When prompted enter the password `pynq` to launch the Jupyter dashboard


* **4. Familiarize yourself with Jupyter dashboard and notebooks**

 * From the Jupyter dashboard navigate to the Getting Started folder and open a Jupyter notebook

 * Open a simple Jupyter notebook and execute some python scripts

 * Explore the series of *Getting Started* Notebook to learn more about  Pynq and how to use the overlays provided to control the peripherals on the Zybo itself as well as other peripherals that can be attached to it.



Hardware installation
=====================

Prerequisites
-------------

* Laptop or desktop with Internet browser (Windows, OSX or Linux)
* Available USB port or power source
* Xilinx Pynq kit

Setup the ZYBO board
--------------------

*If you received a Zybo kit from the Pynq team, all jumpers will be set correctly.*

You can view the `Zybo Setup Video <https://github.com/Xilinx/Pynq/blob/master/micropython/docs/videos/setup_zybo.mp4?raw=true>`_ or follow the steps below.

1. Insert the *Micro SD* card into the ZYBO. (Micro SD slot is underneath the board)

2. Change the JP5 jumper to **SD** (Set the board to boot from the Micro SD card)  

3. Set the JP7 jumper to *USB* (Power the board from the USB cable)

4. Plug the USB cable to your PC/Laptop, and connect to *PROG UART* (J11) on the board

5. *Turn on* the power switch on the board

When you power on the board, you should see a *RED LED* (PGOOD) and a *GREEN LED* (DONE) indicating the system has booted successfully.
